Send the definition to the cache data; _don't_ get data from the cache.

Java features that we will avoid:

 - Concrete inheritance
 - <? extends> and <? super>

On reduction definitions:

We don't want to send serialized versions of arbitrary ReductionDefinitions.
We're afraid of classloader magic, so minimize it, where possible.
For example: don't load classes over http; prefer to http across a jar or well defined zip of jars.
